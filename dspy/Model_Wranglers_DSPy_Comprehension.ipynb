Now, read the passage please.\\nHFMD usually affects babies who are 1~4 years old, but adults can also be infected. Both EV71 and Cox A16 can cause HFMD, which usually starts with a slight fever followed by blisters   and ulcers   in the mouth and rashes   on the hands and feet.\\nIt can be spread through people with the mucus   or feces   of an _ person. It usually appears during the summer and autumn months. HFMD isn't Bird Flu, SARS or Mad Cow Disease, but it's not a new one, either. It first appeared in New Zealand in 1957. About forty years later, it appears in Asia. It's reported that it breaks out every 2 or 3 years.\\nHFMD is very terrible and there is no vaccine   now, but we can do something helpful to prevent it. 'Children with HFMD should seek medical treatment as early as possible', experts say. They also suggest that parents keep the air fresh in a child's room, which should be kept clean, tidy and dry. Children should be taught to wash their hands regularly. Staying away from crowded public places is also basic.\", 'question': 'HFMD is usually spread with   _  .', 'options': \"['feces', 'feces of an infected person', 'water', 'mucus']\", 'answer_option': 'B', 'answer': 'feces of an infected person'}) (input_keys={'question', 'context', 'options'})\n",

The word \"blogger\" means a person who writes diaries online.\\nMany bloggers are teens who\\'ve been logging  onto sites to discuss anything in their lives. Many of today\\'s teenagers are not afraid to openly discuss everything in their lives. Teens complain  about parents and homework. They share diaries, post songs from the latest bands and show pictures of theirs. They write their own poems, say something about their girlfriends or boyfriends and complain to each other or offer support. But mostly they just write down what they do every day.\\nHowever, many parents are afraid of these young bloggers. Parents see the kids talking about how they got drunk last weekend and how they don\\'t like studying. They are using language that is surprising to their parents. Besides hearing from their friends, teen bloggers also get message from strangers. Most of the time, it\\'s older men asking to meet teenage girls. \"These strange men are dangerous for my kids. They sometimes teach my kids bad words, \" said Cara Cabral, a mother of two.\\nMany teens and young adults know it\\'s not safe to use blogs on the Internet.
